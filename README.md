# Lab 8 — The Agent is the Interface

[Sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-command-line) regularly — the lab gets updated.

## Product brief

> Your team has been running the LMS backend for weeks. Everyone queries data through the React dashboard or Swagger UI. Your team lead wants a new kind of interface: an AI agent that anyone can talk to in natural language. Nanobot is a lighter version of OpenClaw, and this kind of agent is becoming the new intelligent AI user interface. Instead of clicking through dashboards, users just ask questions — "which lab has the lowest pass rate?", "any errors in the last hour?" — and the agent figures out which API calls to make.
>
> Set it up from scratch. Wire it into the system. Then extend it with observability tools so it can answer questions about system health too.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do the whole lab on your **VM**. You can work through a plain SSH shell or through `VS Code` Remote-SSH. When this guide says `localhost`, it means the VM itself or a forwarded port from that VM. Do not install or run `nanobot` on your main machine.

## What you will learn

By the end of this lab, you should be able to say:

> 1. I can explain what makes an AI agent different from a regular client like a web app or a bot.
>    It is not just a self-hosted chat window: it has tools, skills, memory, and can act proactively.
> 2. I set up nanobot from scratch — created the project, installed the framework, connected it to the Qwen API, wired it into Docker Compose, and talked to it.
> 3. I saw what a bare agent does without tools (hallucinates) vs. with MCP tools (answers correctly) — and I understand why.
> 4. I built MCP tools that let the agent query logs and traces, turning observability data into a conversational interface.
> 5. I used the agent to investigate a failure, fix a planted bug, and configure it to report system health proactively.

## Architecture

By the end of the lab, the system looks like this.

In Lab 7 you built one client around your own LLM loop. Here, the agent becomes a shared system layer that multiple clients can talk to — and that layer has reusable tools, memory, and scheduled actions.

         +-------+-------+
         |               |
   [LMS Tools]   [Observability Tools]

```

### What you start with

- **LMS app**: the React dashboard, FastAPI backend, and PostgreSQL database.
- **Platform services**: Caddy reverse-proxies all traffic, and the Qwen Code API gives your agent access to the LLM.
- **Observability stack**: OpenTelemetry Collector, VictoriaLogs, and VictoriaTraces already collect system telemetry.

### What you add

- **Nanobot agent**: a natural-language interface to the LMS that can reason, call tools, and answer questions.
- **Web chat client**: a WebSocket channel plus a Flutter web UI at `/flutter`, protected by `NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY`.
- **New agent capabilities**: LMS MCP tools first, then observability MCP tools, then a scheduled health-check job.

## Tasks

### Prerequisites

1. Complete the [lab setup](./lab/setup/setup-simple.md#lab-setup)

> **Note**: First time in this course? Do the [full setup](./lab/setup/setup-full.md#lab-setup) instead.

### Required

1. [Set Up the Agent](./lab/tasks/required/task-1.md) — install nanobot, configure Qwen API, add MCP tools, write skill prompt
2. [Deploy and Connect a Web Client](./lab/tasks/required/task-2.md) — Dockerize nanobot, add WebSocket channel + Flutter chat UI
3. [Give the Agent New Eyes](./lab/tasks/required/task-3.md) — explore observability data, write log/trace MCP tools
4. [Diagnose a Failure and Make the Agent Proactive](./lab/tasks/required/task-4.md) — investigate a failure, schedule in-chat health checks, fix a planted bug

### Optional

1. [Add a Telegram Bot Client](./lab/tasks/optional/task-1.md) — same agent, different interface

## Task 2: Deploy agent in Docker

## Task 3: Observability MCP tools

## Task 4: Fix bug + cron health check

## Task 2: Deploy agent in Docker
